# Sc-line-forecast
Sc line forecast is used to forecast the dissipation time of coastal stratocumulus clouds. The dissipation time is predicted by combining physical insights with statistical methods. Short-term GHI forecast accuracy is improved during Sc days. This method is tested in central and northern California on 25 days and in southern California on 19 days.
